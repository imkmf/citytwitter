# citytwitter

This is the repo for citytwitter, a tool for querying and displaying social media accounts associated with a city. It was originally created for the city of Los Angeles.

This project was inspired by reading about [la-twitter](https://github.com/hackforla/la-twitter) -- I wanted a way for other cities or tech/politics people in those cities to create a resource to access all these accounts.

Sorry, it's kind of technical right now: the static page is constructed from a validated JSON.

Thanks to [avatars.io](https://www.avatars.io) for the excellent avatar loading tool!
